CPU multicore consumes:
5W/h in idle
75W/h in full load

1000 processes (apps):

70 min each if innefficient (algorithmic)
0.01 seconds each if efficient (algorithmic)

Knowing that the price per kW is1$

Find the amount of time (hours, minutes, seconds) for 1000 apps (inef vs effi)
Find the amount of dollars to be spent with power


POWER:

75kW/h x 1000 apps x TOTAL min ???

87.5 $

IF INEFFICIENT:

70000 min (around 49 days)



EFFICIENT

10 sec
0.002 $ in total
